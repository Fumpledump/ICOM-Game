    m_Localized: "\n\tInternational Museum Day 2023 focuses on sustainability and
      well-being. Museums are key contributors to the well-being and the sustainable
      development of our communities. All museums have a role to play in shaping
      and creating sustainable futures, and they can do this through educational
      programs, exhibitions, community outreach, and research. \r\n\n\tEach year
      since 2020, the International Museum Day Supports a set of Goals from the Sustainable
      Development Goals of the United Nations. In 2023, the focus will be on:\r\n\n-Goal
      3 Global Health and Well-being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being
      for all at all ages, in particular concerning mental health and social isolation.\r\n\n-Goal
      13 Climate Action: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,
      adopting low-carbon practices in the Global North and mitigation strategies
      in the Global South.\r\n\n- Goal 15 Life on Land: Protect, restore, and promote
      sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, amplifying the voices of Indigenous
      leaders and raising awareness on the loss of biodiversity.\r\n\n\tMy Mini Museum
      primarily focuses on Goal 3, by creating a game that allows for one to be present
      in the moment and reflect on what brings them joy.\r\n"
